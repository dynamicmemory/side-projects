<h2>Developer log
<h3><b>Wednesday the 11th of June, 2025<b>

Decided I should start keeping a log of everything i'm doing for this project.<br>

Recap so far is about 10 days I started "programming for the ground up" a book <br>
on assembly and I kinda just got addicted to it and smashed it out in a week. <br>
Now i'm out here and I really do be making everyones least favourite app... the <br>
todo list, but now in assembly! why you might ask... maaan cmon I need a todo app <br>
that can keep up with how fast I am at doing things... assembly is exactly the <br>
language my todo list needs to be written in, it truly is performance critical. <br>

Ok recap done, as for today... well I think I want to acheive deleting todos and <br>
ill be pretty much finished with this program. That being said im sure something <br>
will pop up making this an hours long affair... assembly's great, I love it. <br>
Seriously I do though..

Well 3hrs later... exactly what i thought, didn't go straight as forward as i thought<br>
but I learnt some new machine instructions and I figured out how to do what I'm trying<br>
to do... delete a todo... got it all mapped out and the separate pieces built, ill just<br>
put it all together tomorrow... surely it will be that smooth. One more thing to <br>
note, im very uncomfortable with bytes and moving them around, this was kind of a <br>
little break through with more understanding about not just words in assembly but <br>  
breaking the register up into its bytes.
